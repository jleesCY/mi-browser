# mi. Browser 🌐

**mi.** (pronounced "my") is a hyper-lightweight, distraction-free mobile browser designed for the modern web. It strips away the clutter of traditional mobile browsers, replacing bulky toolbars with a single, floating "Pill" that responds to your gestures. It is fast, minimal, and customizable to fit your style.

## 🪶 Why mi.?

### Minimal & Lightweight
Most browsers are bloated with unnecessary features. **mi.** is built to be invisible. It gets out of your way so you can focus on what you need to do.

### One-Handed Design
Smartphones are getting bigger, but our hands aren't. **mi.** moves all navigation to the bottom of the screen within a thumb's reach. No more reaching for the top corner to reload or switch tabs.

## 🔮 The "Pill" Interface

The core of **mi.** is the floating Pill at the bottom of the screen. It is your address bar, your menu, and your navigation controller all in one.

| Gesture on the Pill | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tap** | Search or type a URL |
| **Swipe Up** | Open the Menu (Tabs, History, Settings) |
| **Swipe Down** | Hide the interface completely (Immersive Mode) |
| **Swipe Left/Right** | Go Back or Forward instantly |
